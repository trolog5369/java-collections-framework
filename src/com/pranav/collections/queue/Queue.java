package com.pranav.collections.queue;

public class Queue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // As we have learnt in stack it follows LIFO(Last In First Out)

        // The queue is opposite ie it follows
        // FIFO(First In First Out)
        // It is a collection designed for holding the elements prior to processing

        // Real world example:
        // If we go to the supermarket and purchase some grocery there is a Queue 
        // If you get in First you're the First one to get out and 
        // If you'tre the Last one to get in You're the last one to get out
        // That's (FIFO)

        // Application usage:Printer

        // Queue is a interface and and we have very different permutations 
        // but one of the most popular is linked-list,Priority-Queue,Dequeue and many more..
