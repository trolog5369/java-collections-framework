# Day 02 — 2D Arrays (Java Collections Framework)

This module covers the fundamentals of **2D Arrays in Java**, extending the understanding of 1D arrays into multi-dimensional data structures.

The focus is on how 2D arrays are structured, accessed, and used in real-world grid-based problems.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Understanding 2D arrays (rows × columns)
- Indexing in 2D arrays
- Nested loops for traversal
- Initializing a matrix programmatically
- Updating specific cells in a grid
- Inline initialization of 2D arrays
- Printing 2D arrays using `Arrays.deepToString()`

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- 2D arrays are **arrays of arrays**
- Indexing follows the pattern `[row][column]`
- Nested `for` loops are required for traversal
- `Arrays.toString()` does not work for 2D arrays  
  → `Arrays.deepToString()` must be used
- 2D arrays are ideal for representing grids such as:
  - Game boards (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe)
  - Matrices
  - Table-like data
