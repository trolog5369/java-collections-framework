## 📦 Arrays — Foundation of Data Structures

This section documents my hands-on understanding of **Java Arrays**, treated as a core building block for all future data structures.

I focused on **how arrays behave**, not just how to declare them.

### What I Practiced & Understood

- Fixed-size nature of arrays and its implications
- Zero-based indexing and bounds safety
- Internal memory behavior (why resizing is not allowed)
- Read vs write operations and their trade-offs
- Forward and reverse traversal techniques
- Enhanced for-loops vs traditional loops
- Using `java.util.Arrays` utility methods
- Stream-based traversal for cleaner iteration

### Key Files

- **`Array.java`**
  - Conceptual notes and limitations of arrays
  - Why arrays are fast for access but rigid for modification

- **`TheArrays.java`**
  - Array creation techniques
  - Index-based insertion and overwriting
  - Traversal (normal, reverse, enhanced for-loop)
  - Stream-based iteration
  - Common runtime pitfalls (index out of bounds)

- **`ArraysUtility.java`**
  - Practical use of `Arrays.toString()`
  - Overview of utility methods (`equals`, `compare`, `binarySearch`, etc.)
  - Reinforces clean inspection of array data

### Why This Matters

Arrays are not just a syntax feature — they are the **base layer** for:
- 2D Arrays
- Lists & ArrayList
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash-based structures

This foundation is intentionally solid before moving into higher abstractions.

➡️ **Next:** 2D Arrays (matrix-style data representation and traversal)
