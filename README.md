# Java Collections Framework

## Overview

This repository documents my structured and hands-on learning of the **Java Collections Framework**.
The goal is not just to “know the syntax”, but to **understand when, why, and how** to use different collections in real backend systems.

This repo is part of my **Java → Backend → Full Stack** journey and will directly support upcoming work with **JDBC, Spring Boot, and real-world data handling**.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most beginners *use* collections.
Very few actually **understand their behavior, performance, and trade-offs**.

This repository focuses on:

* Correct usage over shortcuts
* Internal behavior where it matters
* Practical examples instead of theory-only notes
* Building instincts required for backend development

---

## Topics Covered (Growing Over Time)

> ⚠️ This is a **living repository** — content will expand and improve.

### Core Collections

* List (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`)
* Set (`HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`)
* Map (`HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`)

### Key Concepts

* Differences between List, Set, and Map
* Iteration techniques
* Mutability and immutability
* Null handling
* Ordering vs sorting
* Performance implications (time & space complexity)
* When *not* to use a particular collection

### Advanced & Practical

* Custom objects in collections
* `equals()` and `hashCode()` importance
* Comparators vs Comparable
* Fail-fast vs fail-safe behavior
* Common mistakes and edge cases

---

## Learning Approach

* Follow a **structured learning path** (currently using Amigoscode)
* Rebuild examples manually instead of copy-pasting
* Experiment with edge cases
* Document insights through code, not long theory files
* Refactor code as understanding improves

---

## How This Fits Into My Bigger Plan

This repository is a **foundation repo**.

Next steps:

* Apply collections heavily in **JDBC**
* Use them in **Spring Boot APIs**
* Handle real application data correctly
* Write cleaner, safer, and more efficient backend code

This is preparation for **production-level Java**, not just interviews.

## Status

🟡 **In Progress**
This README and the codebase will evolve as my understanding deepens.
