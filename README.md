# Java Collections Framework

## Overview

This repository documents my **completed, structured, and hands-on learning** of the **Java Collections Framework**.

The goal was never to just memorize APIs — it was to **understand behavior, performance, trade-offs, and correct usage** of collections in real backend systems.

This repository now serves as a **finished foundation** for upcoming work with **JDBC, Spring Boot, and real-world data handling**.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Most beginners *use* collections.
Very few actually **understand what happens under the hood**.

This repository was built to close that gap by focusing on:

* Correct usage over shortcuts
* Internal behavior where it matters
* Practical examples instead of theory-only notes
* Developing backend-level instincts, not tutorial habits

---

## Topics Covered (Completed)

### Core Collections

* **List**

  * `ArrayList`
  * `LinkedList`

* **Set**

  * `HashSet`
  * `LinkedHashSet`
  * `TreeSet`

* **Map**

  * `HashMap`
  * `LinkedHashMap`
  * `TreeMap`

* **Queue**

  * `LinkedList` (FIFO behavior)

* **Stack**

  * Legacy `Stack` class
  * LIFO behavior and internal working

---

### Key Concepts

* Differences between **List vs Set vs Map**
* FIFO vs LIFO behavior
* Iteration techniques
* Mutability vs immutability
* Null handling across implementations
* Ordering vs sorting
* Performance implications (time & space complexity)
* When **not** to use a particular collection

---

### Advanced & Practical Concepts

* Custom objects inside collections
* Importance of `equals()` and `hashCode()`
* Hashing and bucket-based lookup
* Why HashMap is fast
* Key replacement and duplicate handling
* Common beginner mistakes and silent bugs
* Real-world usage patterns

---

## Learning Approach

* Followed a **structured learning path** (Amigoscode)
* Rebuilt examples manually — no blind copy-paste
* Tested edge cases intentionally
* Focused on **code-based understanding**, not long theory docs
* Refactored code as understanding improved

This repository reflects **learning through implementation**, not passive consumption.

---

## How This Fits Into My Bigger Plan

This is a **foundation repository**.

What comes next:

* Heavy usage of collections in **JDBC**
* Real data handling in **Spring Boot APIs**
* Correct modeling of application data
* Writing cleaner, safer, and more efficient backend code

This repository prepares me for **production-level Java**, not just interviews.

---

## Status

🟢 **Completed**

The Java Collections Framework has been fully covered.
This repository is now **stable and complete**.
